# Functional Programming

A short overview of functional programming, intended for junior Javascript developers who have zero experience in functional programming. This is still a work in progress.

# Introduction

What is functional programming?
* Most of the time we code in an object-oriented style.

1. Pure Functions
  * Benefits:

2. Recursion
  * Benefits:
  * Drawbacks:
    * Javascript is an (arguably) interpreted language. That is, it does not get turned into binary until it is about to be executed, line by line. This means that compilers cannot optimise for tail-end recursion calls, putting a cap of 10000 functions on the call stack. This can turn into a very real technical limitation for a Javascript program.

3. Immutable Data
